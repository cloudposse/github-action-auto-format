# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Github Action Auto-Format runs several repository "hygiene" tasks for repositories:
  - The `readme` target will rebuild `README.md` from `README.yaml`.
  - The `github_format` target adds all of Cloud Posse's standard repository housekeeping files (including GitHub Actions workflows) to the repository's `.github` folder.
  - The `terraform_format` target ensures consistent formatting across all Terraform files in the repository.

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  If you haven't already, follow the steps in the [quickstart](#quickstart) section.
  To choose which pieces of functionality will be executed, modify the `script-names:` input to the `cloudposse/github-action-auto-format` step to be a comma-separated list of one or more targets (e.g., `script-names: readme,terraform_format,github_format`).
  This is an exhaustive list of all valid `script-name`s:
    - `readme`
    - `github_format`
    - `terraform_format`
  If you're using the `auto-format.yml` workflow file distributed within this repository, then the Auto-format GitHub Action will trigger on pull request events, once a day at 7am UTC, and upon manual triggering via the `workflow_dispatch` mechanism.

# Example usage
examples: |-
  Here's a real world example:
  - [`github-action-auto-format`](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-auto-format/.githu/workflows/auto-format.yml/) - Cloud Posse's self-testing Auto-format GitHub Action

# How to get started quickly
quickstart: |-
  Here's how to get started...
  1. Copy `.github/workflows/auto-format.yml` to the corresponding folder in your target repo.
  2. Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) that has the `workflow` permission *using an account that has at least `write` permissions in the target repo* by following the directions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) and selecting the `workflow` tick box on the token creation screen, if you don't have one already.
  3. Add this token as a secret to your target repository and replace the default token name in the `workflow-token:` input of the `github-action-auto-format` step to the name of your token.
  4. Change the `bot-name:` input of the `github-action-auto-format` step to the name of the user who generated the token in step 2. *This user must have at least `write` permissions in hte target repo.`
  5. The default setting for the Auto-format GitHub Action to execute all of its functionality when run. If you'd like to use a subset of the full functionality, modify the `script-names:` input of the `github-action-auto-format` step as detailed in the [usage](#usage) section.
  6. Optional - You may want to change when the scheduled cron trigger is executed. If you'd like a guide, here's a useful resource for help in crafting cron strings: https://crontab.guru/
